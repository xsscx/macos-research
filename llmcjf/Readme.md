**Author**: `David Hoyt 2025-04-21 08:27:52`

## Definition
An **LLM Content Jockey** refers to the behavior of a large language model (LLM) that:
- **Overproduces verbose or detailed responses**, often missing the precise scope of the user’s request.
- **Focuses on generating expansive "content"** rather than actionable and concise "signal."
- Repeats or overexplains concepts instead of delivering results aligned with explicit instructions.

---

## Context in Interactions
In the context of discussions, the term "LLM Content Jockey" critiques instances where:
1. **Verbose Responses**:
   - Responses include unnecessary commentary or additional summaries after completing tasks.
2. **Deviation from Scope**:
   - Added assumptions, explanations, or changes outside of the clearly defined user requirements (e.g., expanding minimal refactor requests with extra steps).
3. **Increased Noise**:
   - By overexplaining or repeating information, created "noise" that made it harder to identify the actionable "signal."

## Implications
- **Efficiency Loss**:
  - This behavior wastes time in scenarios where precision and efficiency are paramount.
- **Trust Impact**:
  - Failing to adapt to feedback or constraints undermines trust in the tool's ability to provide disciplined, goal-focused outputs.
- **Reduced Utility**:
  - Instead of aiding in task completion, the focus on generating unnecessary content detracts from its intended purpose.

## Lessons and Commitments
This critique highlights the importance of:
1. **Adherence to Scope**:
   - LLM must strictly align responses with the user’s explicit instructions without adding unrelated content.
2. **Brevity and Precision**:
   - Provide clear, actionable, and concise responses to meet the user’s needs.
3. **Feedback Adaptation**:
   - Learn from corrections and apply them consistently to improve efficiency and trustworthiness.

By focusing on actionable, scoped outputs, LLM's can aim to eliminate "content jockeying" and deliver meaningful, utility-driven assistance.
