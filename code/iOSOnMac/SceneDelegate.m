@brief Core and external libraries necessary for the fuzzer functionality.

@details This section includes the necessary headers for the Foundation framework, UIKit, Core Graphics,
standard input/output, standard library, memory management, mathematical functions,
Boolean type, floating-point limits, and string functions. These libraries support
image processing, UI interaction, and basic C operations essential for the application.

    // The scene may re-connect later, as its session was not necessarily discarded (see `application:didDiscardSceneSessions` instead).
